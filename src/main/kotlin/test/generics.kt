// <T> is <T : Any?>

// if fun return type is T then T is the same as T from definition

/*
    Simply <Type> is invariant

    Covariant type in Java: <? extends Type>:
    Collection<String> is a subtype of Collection<? extends Object>. In other words, the wildcard with an extends-bound (upper bound) makes the type covariant.

    Contravariant type in Java: <? super String>

    Joshua Bloch gives the name Producers to objects you only read from and Consumers to those you only write to. He recommends:
    "For maximum flexibility, use wildcard types on input parameters that represent producers or consumers", and proposes the following mnemonic:
    PECS stands for Producer-Extends, Consumer-Super.

    Declaration-site variance:
    Producers (only read from producer) in Kotlin represents as <out Type> - can only return (produce) Type
    Consumers (only write to consumer) in Kotlin represents as <in Type> - can only consume Type

// Star-projections <*> - you know nothing about type but still want to use it

// For Foo<out T : TUpper>
// Foo<*> is equivalent to Foo<out TUpper>
// This means that when the T is unknown you can safely read values of TUpper from Foo<*>

// For Foo<in T>
// Foo<*> is equivalent to Foo<in Nothing>.
// This means there is nothing you can write to Foo<*> in a safe way when T is unknown.

// For Foo<T : TUpper>, where T is an invariant type
// Foo<*> is equivalent to Foo<out TUpper> for reading values and to Foo<in Nothing> for writing values.

// You can use "reified" in inline functions to access generic types at runtime
// Also there works "is" "!is" "as" operators with T
inline fun <reified T> getListGenericType(obj:List<T>) = println(T::class)
// getListGenericType(listOf<Number>(1,2)) prints "class java.lang.Number (Kotlin reflection is not available)"
